# wave-generator Notes

## Development Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [x] Next.js project with Bun already set up
- [x] Some basic UI components already installed (button, slider, etc.)
- [x] Create the core audio engine for binaural beat generation
- [x] Implement the main WaveGenerator component
- [x] Update the homepage to use the WaveGenerator component

### Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Create the AudioEngine class in lib/audio/engine.ts
2. ✅ Implement the WaveGenerator component in components/wave-generator.tsx
3. ✅ Update app/page.tsx to use the WaveGenerator component
4. ✅ Test basic functionality

### Notes

- The AudioEngine uses Web Audio API to generate binaural beats with different frequencies in each ear
- The WaveGenerator component provides a user interface with sliders for controlling:
  - Carrier Frequency (the base frequency)
  - Beat Frequency (the difference between left and right ear frequencies)
  - Volume level
- Future enhancements will include:
  - Wave type selection (sine, square, etc.)
  - Background noise generation
  - Preset management
  - Audio visualization
  - Export to WAV functionality

### Next Steps (Phase 2)

- Implement wave type selection
- Add background noise generation
- Create the preset system with built-in presets
- Develop basic visualization for the audio
