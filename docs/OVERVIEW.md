# wave-generator Overview

I want to build an advanced binaural sound generator app called `wave-generator` to use as a brainwave entrainment tool.

`wave-generator` is a Bun-based Next.js 15 app using React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui components, the Web Audio API, and other modern libraries and APIs.

Inspiration: [BrainAural](https://brainaural.com/)

## Features

### Initial Features

- UI with controls for carrier (main) frequency, volume level, and other binaural sound settings
- Presets with sound settings for various purposes (deep sleep, relaxation, focus, etc.) and devices (headphones, phone speaker, etc.)

### Future Features

- Create and save custom sound settings presets
- Share presets with others via links
- Download sounds as WAV files
